# Reflex-Training-Game
#This is a simple game that is intended to help train reflexes. The game increases in difficulty after each correct reaction. To build this circuit, you will need one 360 degree servo, 12 LEDs, 1 pushbutton (you need at least 1, but I am using a seperate one for resetting the game), 12 TCRT5000 sensors, and one .09" OLED screen.
